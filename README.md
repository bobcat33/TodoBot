# TodoBot
A simple Discord bot made for my Advanced Higher Computing coursework project. Utilises a MySQL server to store a to-do list for each of its users.

This has not been optimised at all as it is only a school project.

Also please note that the config.json is not fully complete and the values for `dbHost`, `dbUser`, `dbPass` and `token` all need to be filled.
